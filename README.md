# InteractiveVideoPlayer

This repository contains the solution to the coding challenge presented by Patagonian as part of the recruitment process for the Overplay client.

This is a small SwiftUI app that implements an interactive video player that streams a video from a remote URL, and reacts to changes in the device's orientation and location. It also reacts to device shakes.

The following technologies were used to build the app:
* SwiftUI
* Combine
* Core Motion
* Core Location
* AVKit
* iOS SDK version 15.2
* CocoaPods

## Installation

No special configuration is needed because the app does not rely on third-party libraries.

It uses the CocoaPods dependency manager, but no third-party dependencies were needed.
